# Security-OS - Defense Mode

This directory contains scripts, configurations, and tools designed to protect the system from attacks. Defense Mode focuses on providing guided steps for implementing security measures and monitoring for threats.

**Key Features:**

*   **Pre-configured Defensive Tools:** Includes a selection of popular and effective security tools.
*   **Custom Script Support:** Easily add your own scripts to enhance the system's defenses.
*   **Guided Steps:** Step-by-step instructions are provided for effectively using the included tools and scripts.

**Available Scripts/Tools:**

*   **usb-autokill:** (See [usb-autokill Repository]([Link to your usb-autokill repository])) This script automatically disables USB ports if unauthorized activity is detected. Guided steps are available in the documentation.
*   **fakebeacon:** (See [fakebeacon Repository]([Link to your fakebeacon repository])) This script generates fake network beacons to confuse attackers. Guided steps are available in the documentation.
*   **[More to come!]** - More tools and scripts will be added as the project develops.

**Adding Your Own Scripts:**

1.  Place your script in this directory.
2.  [Describe how to make the script executable if necessary - e.g., `chmod +x your_script.sh`]
3.  [Describe how to integrate the script into the system - e.g., add it to a startup script, create a systemd service, etc.]
4.  **Documentation:** Create documentation with clear, guided steps on how to use your script for defense.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Configuration:** Carefully configure all defensive tools to meet your specific security needs. The guided steps will help you with this.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor system logs and security alerts to identify potential threats.
