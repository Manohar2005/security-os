**A Student Project by [Your Name]** (Replace with your name)

This project aims to create a dual-mode environment based on Debian, designed to provide guided steps for exploring both offensive and defensive security tools. It's a hands-on system where you can easily access pre-existing security tools and even integrate your own scripts, with helpful guidance along the way.

**Important: This project is under active development. Expect changes, improvements, and potential bugs!**

## The Vision

Security-OS provides a platform to explore security practices with clear, actionable steps, presented in two modes:

*   **Attack Mode:** Discover how to use common penetration testing tools and techniques through guided examples.
*   **Defense Mode:** Learn how to implement security measures and monitor for threats with step-by-step instructions.

The goal is to provide a practical and accessible way to get started with cybersecurity by actively participating in both offensive and defensive scenarios.

## Key Features (Planned)

*   **Debian Base:** Leverages the stability and vast software repository of Debian.
*   **Dual-Mode Operation:** Easily switch between Attack and Defense modes.
*   **Pre-Installed Tools:** Includes a selection of popular and well-documented security tools in both modes.
*   **Custom Script Integration:** Allows users to add their own scripts to both Attack and Defense modes, encouraging experimentation and customization.
*   **GUI Interface:** A user-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation and tool management (Work in Progress).
*   **Guided Steps:** Documentation provides step-by-step instructions for using the security tools included (Work in Progress).

## Repository Structure

*   **`docs/`:** Documentation for the OS, tools, and guided steps.
*   **`src/`:** Source code for core OS components (e.g., mode switching). *(Currently empty, future development)*
*   **`gui/`:** Source code for the graphical user interface. *(Currently empty, future development)*
*   **`attack_mode/`:** Scripts and configurations related to offensive security tools.
*   **`defense_mode/`:** Scripts and configurations related to defensive security tools.
*   **`scripts/`:** Scripts for automating security tasks and OS management.
*   **`installer/`:** Scripts to install and configure Security-OS.
