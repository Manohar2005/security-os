# Security-OS - Attack Mode

This directory contains scripts, configurations, and tools used for penetration testing and offensive security exploration. Attack Mode provides a safe and controlled environment to explore these tools with guided examples.

**Important: Use these tools responsibly and ethically. Do not use them against systems without explicit permission. This is for educational purposes only.**

**Key Features:**

*   **Pre-configured Offensive Tools:** Includes a selection of popular and well-documented penetration testing tools (e.g., `nmap`, `metasploit`, `wireshark`).
*   **Custom Script Support:** Easily add your own scripts to automate tasks or explore new attack vectors.
*   **Guided Steps:** Each tool comes with guided steps to help you use it effectively.

**Available Tools:**

*   `nmap`: Network scanner for discovering hosts and services. See the documentation for guided steps on how to use it.
*   `metasploit`: Penetration testing framework for exploiting vulnerabilities. See the documentation for guided steps on how to use it.
*   `wireshark`: Network protocol analyzer for capturing and analyzing network traffic. See the documentation for guided steps on how to use it.
*   `[More to come!]` - More tools and scripts will be added as the project develops.

**Adding Your Own Scripts:**

1.  Place your script in this directory.
2.  [Describe how to make the script executable if necessary - e.g., `chmod +x your_script.sh`]
3.  [Describe how to integrate the script into the system - e.g., add it to a menu, create an alias, etc.]
4.  **Documentation:** Create documentation with clear, guided steps on how to use your script.
